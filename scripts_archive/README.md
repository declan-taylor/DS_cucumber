`binaryVariables.R` is the code used to make the longitudinal dataframe used 
for many of our analyses. `tempData.R` is the code used to analyze the 
temperature data, and create the temperature/time plot.

`/figure_scripts` contains all the individual R scripts used to make figures.
`stats_scripts` contains all the individual R scripts used to run statistical 
analyses.

All of the annotated code from these individual scripts that was used in the 
data analyses behind our manuscript can be found in the RMarkdown file titled
`FarrTaylor_code_DSADA2021.Rmd` housed in the main directory.
