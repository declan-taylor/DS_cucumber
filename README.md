### Statistics

All scripts that generated stats can be found in the folder `stats_scripts`. 

**Spawning** and **mortality** were both analyzed with non-parametric Kruskal-
Wallis tests, and can be found in "spawnStats.R" and "deathStats.R" 
respectively.

**Evisceration** was analyzed with a logistic regression model which can be 
found in "eviscStats.R".

**Stiffening** data (droop and squeeze scores) were analyzed with ordinal 
logistic regression models, which can be found in "stiff_droop_Stats.R".

**Activity** scores were analyzed in "activity_Stats.R".
