Data directory

This directory contains all of the CSV files that were at some point used in 
our R project for exploring and analyzing our data. All the CSVs included are 
based off the master excel workbooks in the `data` folder; please reference 
those for the data collected by Declan Taylor and Jonathan Farr and all
metadata.

1. CSV files used in analyses: (BehaviourData_Final.csv, DailyLog_Final.csv, 
SizeData.csv). See `/raw_data` for descriptions of the purpose of each data
sheet.

2. Unused files in the final code, but used for data manipulation and exploration: 
(BehaviourData.csv, BinaryPlotData.csv, DailyLog.csv)
